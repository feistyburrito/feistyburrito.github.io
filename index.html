            <p>I used to be active and engaged in lot's of acitivities both outdors and indoors.
                Lately, I'm more prone to injuries and it takes longer to heal from them. In reflection, 
                I can say there's a big difference to how freely my physical movements were compared 
                to the present. So let's talk about mobility. Forget about the whole aethetics of a fit 
                body, let's address mobility as we age. Ageing affects muscle mass and strength, bone 
                density, and can make joints stiffer and less flexible due to reduction of cartilage 
                thickness. As we age, muscles, bones and joints undergo physiological changes that 
                affect mobility, which can ultimately impact our independence.
                Age-related changes to muscles, bones and joints can be reversed. I can start by living 
                a more active lifestyle. Not only will I feel better with everyday movements, but I will also 
                be able to get back to the life and activities I enjoy. This has to be done by stages to
                make sure the habit stays. Assesing my current activity level and increasing it even by 1% daily 
                will help me in the long run. Mobility is important but a lot of young folks like myself take
                it for granted.</p>
